<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This written tutorial will show you how to setup and use the tools and
best practices developed by the frameworks team. These best practices
were inspired and developed from this [framework
example](https://github.com/nd-crane/framework-example).

## Example Projects

In addition to this tutorial two other github repositories can be used
for refrence. These both include scale implementations of the frameworks
toolkit.

1.  [Natural Language Processing on FAA
    Data](https://github.com/nd-crane/Explain2Me-Framework-Exampled) -\>
    This repo contains a full knoweledge extraction pipeline from data
    collection to model training and inference using the tools and best
    practices detailed below.
2.  [Computer Vision analysis on Facial
    Recongition](https://github.com/nd-crane/Explain2Me-Framework-Example)
    -\> This repo contains analysis on GradCAM output and emphasizes our
    way of experimentation.

## Recommended Tools

### PDM

> PDM, as described, is a modern Python package and dependency manager
> supporting the latest PEP standards. But it is more than a package
> manager. It boosts your development workflow in various aspects. The
> most significant benefit is it installs and manages packages in a
> similar way to npm that doesn’t need to create a virtualenv at all!

### nbdev

> Create delightful software with Jupyter Notebooks. Write, test,
> document, and distribute software packages and technical articles —
> all in one place, your notebook.

### DVC

> DVC is built to make ML models shareable and reproducible. It is
> designed to handle large files, data sets, machine learning models,
> and metrics as well as code.
