### PDM

> PDM, as described, is a modern Python package and dependency manager
> supporting the latest PEP standards. But it is more than a package
> manager. It boosts your development workflow in various aspects. The
> most significant benefit is it installs and manages packages in a
> similar way to npm that doesn’t need to create a virtualenv at all!
